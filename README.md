# Flight Forge

Flight Forge allows 3DOF simulations of rocket flights. The workflow is similar to rocketpy. 
One needs to define the following:

## Environment

- wind profile 
- air density.

## Motor (Hybrid)

- Thrust Curve
- Burnrate of solid fuel
- Liquid Flow rate

## Rocket Body
